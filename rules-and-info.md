# Rules

*1.* **Please be civilized when discussing sensitive topics.** If one or both parties are being uncivilized, then the respective parties will be sanctioned.

*2.* **Do not excessively harass other users.** This will lead to severe actions taken against if attempted.

*3.* **Do not spam**, this includes chains as well as pictures or videos. The spam room is acceptable however.

*4.* **Do not advertise.** Instead, ask for a partnership.

*5.* **Keep subjects in the correct channels.** This helps keep our server tidy and separates conversation into relevant categories. The General room is for any topic you'd like to discuss, not just for New The30s & Co.

*6.* **Do not post NSFW, sin, gore, disturbing images, or conversations.** We want to keep our server safe for everybody of all backgrounds of the world, so any sinful content shared will be removed and the provoker will be banned.

*7.* **Any drama or uncivilized conversation is to be stopped immediately.** This is not Twitter, go away!

*8.* **Respect the Conference, servers and members of the CFA.** The Conference and the CFA lead our server forward, so please show respect to them and other servers of the CFA.

*9.* **Do not excessively post crappy memes, related themes or spammy content**, unless in the spam room. Stop spamming Among Us!

*10.* **Free speech is guaranteed within this community.** However, we can still sanction you if you harass another user, you do not respect their boundaries, or you continue with a conversation when asked by the opposition to stop.
